This is a simple React Timer app with buttons to start, stop, pause and reset the timer.

Very good for someone who wants to start learning react as this would cover some nice and important topics.

I got this as an assignment in one of the startup companies interview, dont ask the result lol :)

Also follow my YOutube channel Free2Hack , where I would be posting such stuff regularly.
